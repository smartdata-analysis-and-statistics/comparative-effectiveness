## Main Analysis

The main objective of this analysis is to assess whether the number of episodes (y) occurring within specific time periods (years) differs between the treatment groups (1: DMF and 0: TERI). To address potential confounding factors, the researchers consider variables such as patient age, the log of premedical cost (`logPremedicalcost`), previous DMT efficacy (`prevDMTefficacy`), and the number of episodes in previous relapses (prerelapseNum).

When estimating treatment effects from observational data, an assumption is made that the patient populations in both treatment groups are as similar as possible. Various methods for balancing data across treatment groups are proposed, including matching, inverse propensity weighting, stratification, and regression adjustment.

In this case, the focus is specifically on the matching method, which offers advantages over regression adjustment by potentially alleviating issues related to model mis-specification. This includes addressing non-linear relationships between certain confounders and the outcome variable and accounting for treatment effects that may depend on specific confounders (treatment-confounder interaction terms). Propensity scores are used to match subjects in the treatment groups.

Moreover, intentionally introducing incomplete covariate variables in this example adds complexity to the propensity score estimation. Depending on the propensity score estimation technique employed, it may be necessary to incorporate an imputation step. For instance, logistic regression estimation requires complete data for all observations, while XGBoost is robust to missing data \cite{zhao_propensity_2021}.

To estimate marginal treatment effects, the g-computation method is employed \cite{snowden_implementation_2011}. This method involves specifying a model for the outcome dependent on the treatment and covariates. The potential outcomes, i.e., the predicted values of the outcome on treatment ($y_i^1$) and control ($y_i^0$) for each sample unit $i$, are estimated. The marginal treatment effect is then calculated by contrasting the averaged estimated potential outcomes.


In this example, we consider the estimation of comparative treatment effects in the absence of treatment-effect heterogeneity.


## Estimation workflow

The proposed workflow consists of the following steps:

![Estimation Workflow](resources/chapter 09/Workflow.png)

1.  **Data Exploration:** In this step, we examine the observed data to comprehend the variables within the dataset. Our primary focus lies on identifying missing patterns and relationships among observed variables, including missing indicator variables and others. This exploration aids in discerning the most plausible missing mechanisms and suitable imputation techniques. Additionally, field experts' insights may be incorporated to enhance understanding of the missing process, potentially considering MNAR assumptions.
2.  **Imputation:** It is essential to evaluate whether the imputation procedure is necessary or if simpler methods, such as complete case analysis, are more suitable. In case imputation procedures are required, selecting plausible imputation methods that align with the main model analysis is crucial. This involves choosing individual imputation methods for each incomplete variable, determining the predictor variables on the imputation model. Pre_imputation (where imputation values can be deterministically derived from other variables) and Post-imputation (e.g.ensuring imputed values fall within a reasonable range) steps may also considered.
3.  **Data Balancing:** Several methods, including PS matching or inverse weighting propensity score, can be utilized. It is required to evaluate the balance, which could be done via visual inspection.(eg.cobalt package). In this example, we estimate propensity scores using logistic regression. For most balancing procedures in R, counterparts specifically designed for imputed datasets are available, such as those in the matchthem R package, which includes PS matching and IPW as done in the matchit R package.
4.  **Model Fit:** : It is fit a model to predict the outcomes for each sample unit under each possible treatment value (DMF and TERI), as predictors include the treatment and optionally the baseline covariates and also the propensity score.
5.  **Treatment Estimation & Pooling:** For simplicity in this tutorial, we will use the comparison functions from the R **matchingmethods** package \cite{arel_marginaleffects_2023}, which can be used for completed data and also from outputs from the imputation process. In the last case, internally the functions calculate the treatment effects on each imputed dataset and pool the estimates using Rubin's Rules.

Let's start by preparing the R environment. All the functions used in this tutorial can be found in the resource file `functions.r`.

## Homogeneous Treatment Effect

In this example, we focus on estimating comparative treatment effects in the absence of heterogeneous treatment effects (HTE).
