In this chapter, we will introduce key quality concerns of RWD, including their accuracy, completeness, and timeliness. Subsequently, we will discuss which steps can be taken to assess the quality of RWD, and determine their fitness for use. The chapter will also introduce directed acyclic graphs to explain how the analysis of RWD may be affected by different types of bias. We will put particular focus on confounding bias, selection bias, and information bias, and explain how these biases can be addressed by referring to specific chapters from the book. Finally, the chapter presents common quality appraisal tools that can be used to assess the quality of real-world evidence (for instance when conducting a systematic review).\n\n## Example code\n\nA risk of bias assessment was conducted in the COVID-NMA review. We can create a summary table of risk of bias assessment and produce a traffic light plot as follows:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='chapter_03_cache/pdf/unnamed-chunk-2_474f4389253fbb8f322208673e6a2f81'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nRisk_of_Bias <- read_excel(\"resources/RoB-covid.xlsx\")\n\n#creation of traffic light plot\ntrafficlight_rob <- rob_traffic_light(data = Risk_of_Bias, tool = \"ROB2\")\ntrafficlight_rob\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](chapter_03_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-2-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Version info {.unnumbered}\nThis chapter was rendered using the following version of R and its packages:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='chapter_03_cache/pdf/unnamed-chunk-3_dc7689147ee9d3725760eefa2762bec4'}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nR version 4.3.0 (2023-04-21)\nPlatform: aarch64-apple-darwin20 (64-bit)\nRunning under: macOS Ventura 13.4\n\nMatrix products: default\nBLAS:   /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.3-arm64/Resources/lib/libRblas.0.dylib \nLAPACK: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.3-arm64/Resources/lib/libRlapack.dylib;  LAPACK version 3.11.0\n\nlocale:\n[1] en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/C/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8\n\ntime zone: Europe/Zurich\ntzcode source: internal\n\nattached base packages:\n[1] stats     graphics  grDevices utils     datasets  methods   base     \n\nother attached packages:\n[1] robvis_0.3.0 readxl_1.4.2\n\nloaded via a namespace (and not attached):\n [1] gtable_0.3.3     jsonlite_1.8.4   dplyr_1.1.2      compiler_4.3.0  \n [5] tidyselect_1.2.0 tidyr_1.3.0      scales_1.2.1     yaml_2.3.7      \n [9] fastmap_1.1.1    ggplot2_3.4.2    R6_2.5.1         generics_0.1.3  \n[13] knitr_1.42       tibble_3.2.1     munsell_0.5.0    pillar_1.9.0    \n[17] rlang_1.1.1      utf8_1.2.3       xfun_0.39        cli_3.6.1       \n[21] withr_2.5.0      magrittr_2.0.3   digest_0.6.31    grid_4.3.0      \n[25] rstudioapi_0.14  lifecycle_1.0.3  vctrs_0.6.2      evaluate_0.21   \n[29] glue_1.6.2       farver_2.1.1     cellranger_1.1.0 codetools_0.2-19\n[33] fansi_1.0.4      colorspace_2.1-0 rmarkdown_2.21   purrr_1.0.1     \n[37] tools_4.3.0      pkgconfig_2.0.3  htmltools_0.5.5 \n```\n:::\n:::\n",
